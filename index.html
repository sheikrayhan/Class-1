            <b>Although</b> the power generation in the country is higher than the demand, we are not being able to fully utilise this capacity during the fuel crisis. Due to lack of gas supply, power plants which are run by costly fuel oil are in operation now to tackle the situation. It has ensured uninterrupted electricity supply for the city dwellers, but the people in rural areas are enduring four hours of power outage on average per day. In the areas near Dhaka, power goes out four to five times a day. <br> <br>
             Such a situation in the power sector of the country came up while speaking to people in several areas and analysing the data of power transmission, generation and distribution companies. The consumers of <strong>Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board (REB)</strong>, the biggest power distribution company of the country, are suffering the most. This is due to inadequate power supply as compared to the demand, several top officials of the company said.
             <pre>
                <b> A total</b> of six companies supply electricity in the country.
                 Of the 42.2 million consumers of electricity in the country, around 33 million are under the REB. 
                 They use 58 per cent of the total electricity generated in the country a day          
                 Officials of the company say the supply deficit is between 500 to 850 MW.
                 As a result, they have to carry out power outages for three to five hours a day.          
                 Parvin Sultana, a resident of Laxmiganj union in Netrokona sadar upazila, said that power goes out even seven to eight times a day in her area.
                 The power outage usually lasts for half an hour to an hour each time. Power goes out even during sehri and iftar as well            
                 Nandan Sarker, a farmer from Dhobaura police station area in Mymensingh, said, â€œWe get electricity for only two hours a day in our village. 
                 On some days, the power outage lasts for five hours in the night.
